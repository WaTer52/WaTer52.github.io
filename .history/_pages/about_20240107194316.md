Hi! I am Jiaxin Zhang(张嘉欣), a software engineering junior at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), currently engaged as a research assistant advised by [Prof. Jingkuan Song](https://jingkuansong.github.io/) at [Center for Future Media](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index).
My research focuses on machine learning, Generative Model and Compter Graphics, specifically exploring Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and advanced 3D model generation. I am actively involved in developing a versatile 3D model generation technique. Besides, my academic excellence is underpinned by a strong GPA, reflecting my commitment to my field of study.
